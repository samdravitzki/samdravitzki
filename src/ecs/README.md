## _ECS engine_

Always wanted to learn more about game engine design and ecs and so decided to build one with js and see how it goes

- [ ] Describe what this is, why it exists and what I want to do with it
- [ ] copy in plans and ideas from notebook
- [ ] Publish as npm package

- [] Write down plans and ideas
- Implement demos for different features of ecs engine
- Implement demos of the collision system
- Implement demos for different features of ecs
- Support different collision scenarions (box - box, circle - circle, ...)
- Move to less naiive implementation of collision system
- Add support for events
- Add debug mode to view systems and their average run time

## todos

- [ ] Reset state of engine when it is stopped
- [ ] Canvases dont look good as just squares in the middle of your screen
      <<<<<<< Updated upstream
      =======
- [ ] Describe what `State` is and why its required when components also store state
